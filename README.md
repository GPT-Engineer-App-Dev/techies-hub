# techies-hub

Implement a landing page for the Particles marketplace with the following:

- Header with the Particles logo and a clear value proposition headline explaining it is a marketplace for software talent specializing in web technologies 
- Subheader with more details on the value prop and supported technologies like React, Node, .NET, Go, JavaScript
- Call-to-action button to "Find developers" that links to the /developers page
- A few key benefits of using the marketplace, like vetted talent, quick matching, etc.
- Footer with Particles copyright and links

Use a clean, modern design with a tech-focused color scheme. The Particles logo can just be text for now.
